#+TITLE: APISnoop 1.21 OKRs
#+AUTHOR: ii.coop

* v1.21
  Our goal is to not make radical changes to process or approach, but iterate on our working methods to increase velocity and output in a stable, consistent way.
** **Increase Stable Test Coverage**
*** **KR1 increase new conformant stable endpoints**
In spite of increasing technical challenges:
- Goal: 3/30   - Stretch Goal: 40
- Status: +3 (Merged):
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97327][Read Status, Patch & List APIService +3]]
*** **KR2 clean-up technical debt**
- Goal: Clear [[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/conformance-progress#coverage-by-release][debt back to 1.9]]
6 months of debt to erase!
  1.11 +2: {read,patch}ApiregistrationStatus
- 1.10 +5: {replace,patch,list,...}Apiregistration
- 4 Endpoints to go
- Still in progress, but not there yet.
*** What is in the pipeline
- [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95503][PodProxyWithPath & ServiceProxyWithPath + 12]]
  Promotion PR to merge next week
- [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98018][Service Status Life Cycle +2]]

  New issue to address Apps endpoints in 1.9
*** Apps endpoints
- All the 1.9 Technical debt is in the Apps API group
- An [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/98640][Umbrella Issue]] was created and we are working with SIG App to erase that debt
** **Release Blocking k/k Job**
*** **Progress**
- Gate keeping for new untested endpoints are working
  - 3 New untested endpoints detected in 1.21
  - These were promoted to [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97276][support Alpha features]]
  - The endpoints was mark as "Not eligible for conformance yet"
*** Taking ownership to the community
  - ii currently manage the Ineligible endpoints list
  - This is done via SQL queries in APISnoop
  - We proposed in SIG Architecture to move it
    to the community
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98677][PR  #98677]] will make it happen
** **Other Important News**
*** **Timelines**
- 1.21 [[https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.21#timeline][Time line is out]]
- 14 week cycle with Test freeze on 24 March
*** **Conformance Gate**
- We confirmed that Taylor can remove labels
- Removing labels trigger automatic relabel of the PR
*** CNCF goals, are ii's goal for 2021
- CNCF O2: CNCF projects are viewed as stable and ready for enterprise adoption
  - KR8: Increase Stable Test Coverage for Kubernetes for 2021
    - Less than 75 untested eligible stable GA endpoints remaining.
    - Ensure no new technical debt is incurred.
*** CNCF O7: Excel in DE&I
  - ii is following the lead from CNCF on DE&I
  -  All of the ii team completed The Linux Foundation
    Inclusive Speaker Orientation (LFC101)
    to make DE&I real for our people
  - We are in the process of updating language and naming choices
    in all repo's we control
*** KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe
    We have again submitted a proposal to
    present a Maintainer Track Sessions
    on Conformance progress and it's
    importance.
** **Looking forward to 1.21**
- No radical changes
- Keep same goals as 1.20
- Know that Endpoints get tougher
** **Questions / Feedback**
In what other ways can we support the CNCF?
